== Introduction

This is developer documentation for Dexy. It is far from complete but is under active development.

The sources for this documentation are part of the main dexy repository which
is http://github.com/dexy/dexy

Please visit http://dexy.it/docs/ for a list of all available documentation.

== Data and Storage

Data objects capture the state of Dexy documents at a given stage in filter
processing, and Storage objects handle persistence of data objects. A Dexy
document will have a data object corresponding to its initial state (the
original file to be processed), plus a data object representing the state after
each filter is processed. Each data object has a corresponding storage object.
Filter implementations will call methods on data classes to append and save
data, and to read data from the previous stage in processing or other document
inputs.

For example, here's the `process` method from the `ExampleProcessMethod` class,
which reads input from the `input_data` object, representing the previous data
state, and saving the modified data using the `set_data` method of the
`output_data` object:

{{ src("dexy.filters.example.ExampleProcessMethod.process") }}

Different data classes can expose methods which users and filters can access to
write or read data in useful ways, and different storage classes can implement
different storage options.

=== Data Types

The main role of data types is to provide convenient interfaces to the type of
data being stored.

The basic data class is `Generic` which is designed to store binary data or
unstructured text data. In this case the `_data` attribute contains the raw
binary data or text.

{{ test('test_data.py', 'test_generic_data_stores_string') }}

The next class is `Sectioned` which holds ordered, named sections. These are
usually named sections in a document. When data is loaded in memory, the
`_data` attribute holds a list of dictionaries. The first entry contains
metadata for the document, the subsequent dictionaries contain each section's
content and metadata.

{{ test('test_data.py', 'test_sectioned_data_stores_list_of_dicts') }}

Another class is `KeyValue` which holds dictionary-type data. Unlike sectioned
data, there is no requirement for the entries to be kept in order, and there is
no arbitrary metadata for each section. There are several options for storage
including JSON data files and Sqlite databases.

The `KeyValue` type cannot be initialized with a dictionary. Instead an empty
data object needs to be initialized and then the `append` method must be used
to add keys and values. This ensures that the behavior of the data type is the
same whether the backend is a JSON file or a sqlite database.

{{ test('test_data.py', 'test_keyvalue_data_stores_dict') }}

Additional classes are available which are intended to provide custom
interfaces to data. For example the `BeautifulSoupData` type makes it easy to
apply the BeautifulSoup HTML parser to content, and so in documents you can run
queries using CSS selectors to extract a part of the document you are
interested in.

Creating a plugin with a custom data type is a possible alternative to writing
a filter. With a filter, the results of processing a whole document are cached.
With a custom data type, you can run code on just a piece of a document you are
interested in, but the results will not be cached, the calculation will be
re-run each time the template document is processed. Using custom data types
mean you put more logic in your template documents.

=== Accessing Data Objects

Within a filter, you can access the previous step's output (this step's input)
using the `input_data` attribute.

The filter output is stored in the `output_data` attribute.

=== The data Method

In some classes, you can directly access stored data via the `data()` method.

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.data") }}

Usually you will not call `data()` directly but will call a method designed to
work with the stored data in a transparent way, like `str()`, `keys()`, or
`iter()`.

Different data types in Dexy will implement common methods such as `str()`,
`keys()` and `iter()` appropriately for the type of data they are wrapping.

Where it is meaningless to access the `data()` object, the method should raise
an Exception, as for the KeyValue data type:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.data") }}

=== Loading and Reading Data

Data will typically be loaded automatically when needed by calling the `data()`
method, directly or indirectly. Other methods which access data should do so
via the `data()` method. If necessary, the `data()` method calls the
`load_data()` method, which in turn calls the storage's `read_data()` since
knowledge of where the data is stored and how to load it is the responsibility
of the Storage object.

Here's the `load_data()` method from the base `Data` class:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.load_data") }}

=== String-Like Access

Where it makes sense, the `__unicode__` method should return the contents of a
document as a unicode string.

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.__unicode__") }}

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.__unicode__") }}

The `str` method will convert results of `__unicode__` to an instance of `str`
type:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.__str__") }}

=== Dictionary-Like Access

Data types should support dictionary-style access where appropriate.

Although the `Generic` type does not have sections, it implements
dictionary-style access as though it consists of a single section with name
`"1"`. This way filters can be written which can process either `Generic` or
`Sectioned` data as input data.

TODO: Example of filter which makes use of Generic's dummy sections. Pyg filter maybe?

The `iteritems` method should yield key, value tuples.

Generic:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.iteritems") }}

Sectioned:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.iteritems") }}

KeyValue:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.iteritems") }}

Sqlite3KeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.iteritems") }}

JsonKeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.JsonKeyValueStorage.iteritems") }}

The `items` method should return a list of key, value tuples:

Generic:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.items") }}

Sectioned:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.items") }}

KeyValue:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.items") }}

Sqlite3KeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.items") }}

JsonKeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.JsonKeyValueStorage.items") }}

The `keys` method should return a list of keys:

Generic:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.keys") }}

Sectioned:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.keys") }}

KeyValue:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.keys") }}

Sqlite3KeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.keys") }}

JsonKeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.JsonKeyValueStorage.keys") }}

To allow accessing elements using the `[key]` syntax, the `__getitem__` method
is implemented:

Generic:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.__getitem__") }}

Sectioned:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.__getitem__") }}

KeyValue:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.__getitem__") }}

Sqlite3KeyValueStorage value method:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.value") }}

JsonKeyValueStorage value method:

{{ src("dexy.storage.JsonKeyValueStorage.value") }}

The `__setitem__` method can also be implemented, to allow appending and
setting elements using the `[key]` syntax:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.__setitem__") }}

And the `__delitem__` method allows using the `del` keyword to remove elements:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.__delitem__") }}

{{ test('test_data.py', 'test_sectioned_data_setitem_delitem') }}

{{ issue(108) }}
{{ issue(109) }}

=== Custom Access Methods

Dictionary-style methods represent a generic interface which works for many
situations, and so these methods are implemented across several data types.

Some data types will have additional methods for searching or formatting data.
These can be seen using the `dexy datas` command with `-alias` argument.

The KeyValue data type implements a `like` method for using sqlite like
queries:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.like") }}

Here's the corresponding method on the Sqlite3KeyValueStorage class:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.like") }}

=== Saving Data

The `save()` method must be called to persist data to disk.

The `set_data()` shortcut method is also available, it sets data to the
provided value and then calls save.

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.set_data") }}

Here's the implementation for `Generic`:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.save") }}

And here's the implementations for `Sectioned`:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.save") }}

And here's the implementation for `KeyValue`:

{{ src("dexy.data.KeyValue.save") }}

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.persist") }}

Here's the `persist` method for Sqlite3KeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.Sqlite3KeyValueStorage.persist") }}

And for JsonKeyValueStorage:

{{ src("dexy.storage.JsonKeyValueStorage.persist") }}

=== Exporting Data

The `output_to_file` method writes data to a file. For Generic data this will
just be the raw data which may either be binary data or a string:

{{ src("dexy.data.Generic.__unicode__") }}

For Sectioned data, this writes the unicode-formatted data, so all sections
are combined into a single document, which is usually what you want for
final/canonical output at the end of processing:

{{ src("dexy.data.Sectioned.__unicode__") }}

There's no concept of a canonical output for KeyValue data, it's intended for
use in providing data to other documents.

=== Initializing Data Objects

Data objects do some initialization work in `__init__`:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.__init__") }}

And more in `setup`:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.setup") }}

The `setup` method can be customized but it should always call the
`setup_storage` method and transition the state to `ready`:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.setup_storage") }}

The `storage_class_alias` method is responsible for choosing the correct type
of storage to use:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.storage_class_alias") }}

By default this just reads the `storage-type` setting, but some classes may
automatically determine the class based on file extension.

=== Reconstituting Data Objects

Data objects are designed to be instantiated as standalone objects after a dexy
run, so their data can be used for reporting and querying. The `dexy grep`
command works by loading data objects directly.

To do this, the arguments needed to initialize a data object are stored in batch metadata.

The `args_to_data_init` method is called when saving batch metadata to provide
JSON-serializable initialization args for each data instance:

{{ src("dexy.data.Data.args_to_data_init") }}

`batch` objects can then recreate data objects:

{{ src("dexy.batch.Batch.data") }}

=== Storage Objects

Storage objects are primarily concerned with reading and writing data to the
correct location on the file system or other form of storage, but sometimes
they will handle queries and other methods in order to provide user
transparency at the Data object leveel.

== Filters

== Wrapper & Batches

== Parsers

== Reporters

=== Website Reporter

The Website reporter publishes the same files as the Output reporter, but also
provides utilities designed for websites, such as applying templates to HTML
files and providing data to help users construct site navigation.

It doesn't make sense to generate a website unless all dexy files are
generated, so the website reporter doesn't run if a specific target is chosen
(many links would likely be broken too):

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.run") }}

The `setup` method initializes some instance variables we will use later:

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.setup") }}

As we iterate over all the processed docs, the `should_process` method
determines whether they are properly formed Doc objects which are "canonical":

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.should_process") }}

Then `process_doc` runs the code which writes the document, with any templates
applied, to the report output directory:

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.process_doc") }}

In the case of a HTML file, we may want to apply a template. This will depend
on whether the document already appears to have a HTML header, and the value
of the `ws-template` setting which may be a boolean or the name of a template
to apply.

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.process_html") }}

The header check is rather rudimentary:

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.detect_html_header") }}

The `write_canonical_data` method is inherited from the Output class, and is
used when a document is not a HTML file or a setting determines that HTML
templates should not be applied:

{{ src("dexy.reporters.output.Output.write_canonical_data") }}

In the other cases, the `apply_and_render_template` method is used:

{{ src("dexy.reporters.website.classes.Website.apply_and_render_template") }}

== Templates

Templates are ways of creating dexy examples.

== Command Line Interface

The command line interface for dexy is driven by
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python3-modargs[python3-modargs].

=== init.py

Any function ending with `_command` is automatically exposed as a command. To
keep modules to a manageable size, the various dexy commands are defined in
different modules, but all are imported into `dexy.commands` in the
`__init__.py` file so they can be available to modargs within a single module:

{{ d['/dexy/commands/__init__.py|idio|asciisyn']['import-all-commands'] }}

The `run` method in `dexy.commands` is listed in `setup.py` as a console script entry point:

{{ d['/setup.py|idio|asciisyn']['entry-points'] }}

And this is the first method which will be called whenever a user enters a `dexy` command:

{{ src('dexy.commands.run') }}

The `capture_warnings` method just hides irrelevant warning messages from dexy users:

{{ src('dexy.commands.capture_warnings') }}

Dexy can load a lot of different libraries as it runs various filters, and
deprecation messages and similar warnings are confusing and annoying for end
users.

The `resolve_argv` method is called next:

{{ src('dexy.commands.resolve_argv') }}

It's possible for additional commands to be added to dexy via the plugin
system.  For example, the `dexy-viewer` plugin defines a `ping` command which
can be called as follows:

{{ d['commands.sh|idio|shint|asciisyn']['ping'] }}

{{ d['/tests/test_commands.py|idio|asciisyn']['viewer-ping'] }}

If necessary the `resolve_argv` command calls `resolve_plugin_command` to
look in dexy plugins for the requested command:

{{ src('dexy.commands.resolve_plugin_cmd') }}

Returning to the `run` command we started with:

{{ src('dexy.commands.run') }}

The parsed arguments, module object and a default command are passed to
`parse_and_run_cmd` which delegates to the modargs command of the same name,
and wraps the call with error handling to provide nicer error messages if
there's a problem:

{{ src('dexy.commands.parse_and_run_cmd') }}

The `help` and `version` commands are also defined in the `__init__.py` file:

{{ src('dexy.commands.help_command') }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.version_command') }}

=== cite.py

The `dexy cite` command prints out a bibliographic citation for dexy.

{{ src('dexy.commands.cite.cite_command') }}

{{ d['commands.sh|idio|shint|asciisyn']['cite'] }}

Currently the bibtex format is supported:

{{ src('dexy.commands.cite.bibtex_text') }}

=== conf.py

The main dexy command has a lot of command line options, and for convenience
you can save the option values in a `dexy.conf` file in your project so you
don't have to remember and type them all the time. The `dexy conf` command
generates an example file for you containing all the default dexy options:

{{ src('dexy.commands.conf.conf_command') }}

{{ d['commands.sh|idio|shint|asciisyn']['conf'] }}

If a config file already exists, or if you use the `-p` flag, then config
options are written to stdout instead of written to a file.

{{ d['/tests/test_commands.py|idio|asciisyn']['conf'] }}

=== dirs.py

These commands expose methods for creating and removing dexy's working directories.

The `setup` and `cleanup` command create and remove working directories respectively:

{{ src('dexy.commands.dirs.setup_command') }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.dirs.cleanup_command') }}

The `reset` command cleans out any working files and leaves you with a fresh setup:

{{ src('dexy.commands.dirs.reset_command') }}

=== fcmds.py

Filter commands are intended to be a way for filters to expose some information
to users. For example, filter commands could provide a way for an API to list
available methods.

{{ src('dexy.commands.fcmds.fcmds_command') }}

The `fcmds_command` lists filter commands:

{{ d['commands.sh|idio|shint|asciisyn']['fcmds'] }}

To run a filter command you need to pass the alias and the command name:

{{ d['commands.sh|idio|shint|asciisyn']['run-fcmd'] }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.fcmds.fcmd_command') }}

=== filters.py

The filters module contains dexy's command line reference for filters.

{{ src('dexy.commands.filters.filters_command') }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.filters.help_for_filter') }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.filters.list_filters') }}

=== grep.py

The grep interface is a way to search on the command line for dexy docs and
keys within docs.  (The dexy viewer plugin presents similar information in a
web-based interface.)

{{ src('dexy.commands.grep.grep_command') }}

The grep command calls `print_match` for each match:

{{ src('dexy.commands.grep.print_match') }}

Where it reaches a document which has keys, it may also print the keys (depending on options):

{{ src('dexy.commands.grep.print_keys') }}

And contents of files may also be printed:

{{ src('dexy.commands.grep.print_contents') }}

=== info.py

The info command lets you see where documents are cached and to get
documentation about their available methods. You should know the doc key you
want to search for, you can use `dexy grep` to help you search.

The attributes listed in `info_attrs` and the methods listed in `info_methods`
are displayed.

{{ d['/dexy/commands/info.py|idio|asciisyn']['info-keys'] }}

{{ src('dexy.commands.info.info_command') }}

=== it.py

The main command which actually runs dexy.
